# Version Control
Version control is very important in the devlopment of anything containing files and multiple moving parts. Lets say for example, I have a fully functioning app. It works perfectly and there are no bugs in the entire thing. Then lets say I wanted to add a new functionality to this app. I have it all devoloped and I implement it into the app and it completely breaks the app. 

Without version control I am more or less out of luck, because Now I need to try and remember the old code and fix all of the changes the new code brought in. Alternitavely you can use version control and just go back to the working app as it was before the attempted implementaion of the new feature you tried to add.

I have been using github for my version control.
